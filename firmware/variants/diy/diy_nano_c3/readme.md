**State**:

**Known issues**: 

- ***ESP32C3*** is power hungry MCU (with BLE/WiFi enabled), at least with Meshtastic FW - so it is not best choise for battery powered devices (regular esp32 mcu is better).
      Initial variant, can be enreached with gps/spi pins, but not very interesting while ble sleep mode not working (other esp32c3 boards has this problem too).
  
- ***ESP32C3*** currently has non working USB CDC (it is has problems wirh arduino platform <=2.0.14). Starting arduino platform 2.0.15 problem is solved and we need wait platformio release with this version support.
